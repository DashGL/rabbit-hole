## Lite Hardware concept

In my <Link href='blog/hardware-concept/'>previous post</Link> I outlined three devices
for `Lite`, `Advance` and `Pro`. For the story I've DashGL, I'm focused on the `Advance`
concept. But I want to expand out and design what the `Lite` and `Pro` devices would
look like, and then have something to align in between. Of the three, the `Lite` device
has the lest amount of ambiguity, so it seems like the best place to start.

## Reviewing the Specs

- Screen
  - 3.5” 480 x 320 SPI display
  - 2.8” 480 x 320 SPI display
  - 3.5” 320 x 240 SPI display
  - 2.8” 320 x 240 SPI display
- D-pad, A, B, Start, Select, Home
- Mono Sound
- Board
  - Pi Pico
  - Pi Zero

The `Lite` concept is pretty much in the shape of a Gameboy Color, with the main difference
on the hardware side being a home button in order to return to the menu. And an updated
screen. Otherwise the general size and layout of the hardware would remain the same.

In terms of display, I'm old as fuck, so 2.5 inches is kind of the minimum for me at this
point. I think that 2.8" might fit into the original shell, so some adjustments might be
made for people to not ruin their eyes. For resolution, I would also try for 480x320 in 
a 4:3 ratio, for a Pi Zero reference. But for Pi Pico, the size might need to be reduced to 
something smaller like 320x240. 

## Software experience

For the software experience, I would want to emulate the experience of programming for the
Gameboy Color, by keeping it clunky and trying to force the programmer to understand the
underlying hardware without making the experience too clunky. I think that as a baseboard
the Pi Pico would make an interesting device for this purpose. Or otherwise the Pi Zero
and an SPI display with writing to the framebuffer would also be a possibility.

Instead of providing libraries to extract away the abstractions, in DashGL style we could
force the user to derive their own library and learn a set of underlying concepts along
the way.

## Development Hardware 

The hardest part for me on this is getting the breadboad buttons to
work, so anything I can find in terms of a kit. Would be preferable.
