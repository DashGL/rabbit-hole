# Save State Layout

This is a continuiation of the <Link href="/blog/weeb-stack/">Building a Weeb Stack</Link> post. I'm trying to 
find the right set of tools which makes deploying a static site for tools easier. So far this is the easiest
set of tools that I've found.

## Tooling

For tooling, I've found that Bun, "just works". For `ts-node` I constantly run into the issues of ".ts file extension not recognized"
And other weird issues. When I want to add or run tools or scripts for testing, I've started to reach for bun. I'm not quite sure about
using it as a drop in replacement for Node yet. But at least on the testing and scripting side of things, it's been great to use.

## Meta frameworks

For a Meta Framework I've been mentally going back and forth between Vite and Astro, but ultimately I find myself coming back to
Astro, and there are three reasons for that.

### First Party Integrations

The ability to run `npx astro add <some framework>` and have the ability to have Astro set up and configure everything is a great
experience. I don't have to worry about strapping together something, or spending an hour searching for something. Astro is
realiable in the sense that the team behind it makes sure everything works, and the community will raise bugs if needed.

### HTML First and Stores

The second part is the HTML first approach that Astro has, and that means that my code won't be infected with some framework
from the start. What I mean is having the ability to build everything in HTML and CSS until I'm happy with how it looks and only
then start to add functionality for one component at a time as needed using the island approach. And NanoStores allow for islands
to talk to eachother without having to manage the whole parent-child state of all of the components in the application.

### Familiarity

I'm not sure how much of a dirty word this is, but I will fully acknowledge and embrase that familiarity plays a big role in the
reason to choose Astro over other meta frameworks. Is that I can build tests and tools for Astro and be able to carry those around.
The ability to copy and paste my GitHub deploy `.yml` file is great. Today I created a small script to add a new blog post file
with the front-matter filled in instead of having to copy and page. And also I found out that [Knip](https://knip.dev/) is a thing
in the sense of adding a CI that will go through and check for dead code on each pull requests. 

## Styling

For styling I've fallen in love with Tailwind. It's amazing to not have to switch back and forth to a CSS file. And for the complexity
of what I work on, the list of class names that get added to any component has been pretty mandageable.

This works really well with DaisyUI. Which I'm surprised that I like DaisyUI as much as I do. It's a component library with a
quirkly look and not a lot of customizabilty. But what I find is that I like the look and don't need to customize it. And the
benefit is that it comes with a ton of themes that just work, which is great to work with. But the best part about DaisyUI is 
that it doesn't take a lot of code to work with any component. And a lot of the components work with CSS magic in the background
which also reduces a lot of the code associated with doing anything. 

## Threejs

The last aspect of the stack to account for is the client side functionality. Threejs is a pretty hard requirement, as while it's
not the only 3d library out there, it's the one I'm the most familiar with. And I would prefer to not have to spend the time
to pick up another library as much as I enjoy playing with them. In my case threejs works in the sense of having a format to
target and a method to display assets.

The next question is what to use to build around the tools in terms of Threejs. And there are two options that I'm split between.
The options are Qwik and React. In terms of Qwik, what I like is that it works well with Astro in terms of not having to mess
with the `client:load` parameters in the sense that it's another thing that generally "just works". 

What's kind of annoying is the separation with what runs on the server. In terms of statically generated site, I would prefer
for everything to just run on the client. There's also the aspect of the javascript being split into tiny chunks that get's
loaded on demand. Which is not something that I'm too concerned about in terms of deploying a small tool where that tiny amount
of performance is not something that's going to be too much of a benefit.

And then there's react which has the advantage of being able to use React Three Fiber. And it seems like this might be a preferable
option to get a simple scene set up and pass meshes to it to be able to view them. The part that's concerning to me here is that
i'm already familiar with the vanilla threejs syntax, so it seems kind of weird re-learning the same tool in a different syntax.
And deploying react for a tiny site seems like killing an ant with a sledge hammer. There's preact, but that doesn't have 
support for React Three Fiber, while there [does seem to be a proof of concept](https://twitter.com/Cody_J_Bennett/status/1632674026408558592).

Otherwise in terms of working with the developer experience these two seem very similar in terms of using `.tsx`. I think it's worth
taking a look at React Three Fiber and see if that's a reason to use React, otherwise Qwik seems like simplier option to use. 

### Trying React Three Fiber

After writing the paragraph above, I went back and tested React Three Fiber. And I guess I'm 
alot more familiar with the `.tsx` syntax now, so I found it a lot more intuitve that I did before.

![Basic set up with React Three Fiber](/src/assets/figs/r3f-init.png)

What I'm amazed by is just how simple it makes it. I was able to set up everything I would normally need to write out
by hand, with a few tags and didn't even have to write the events for updating to the window size.
Being able to separate objects in the scenes by tags also makes it look like it's easier to swap out
just the mesh instead of having to reset the whole scene. So it looks like react wins out in terms of 
which client side library to use. 

As a side note, the tool being referenced in this post is called "Horokko Loko" 
and it can be found here: https://github.com/kion-dgl/Horokko-Loko.

## Domains and where to put what

One more aspect of my considerations for a weeb stack is where to put what. I 
think it's easier to use the DashGL namespace, and then use subdomains for any given
tool. What I've been pretty terrible about is the split of where to put what. I think 
I'll be using `dashgl.com` and the DashGL organization on GitHub to host tutorials and 
the main blog. And I can use `dashgl.org` and my personal `kion-dgl` name space as a place
to put tools.

The thing about tools is as much as I have some stupid idea about how I want to make something 
cool. With reverse engineering, it's always uncertain about what i'll actually run into
which means that I'll more than likely hit a wall, and need to make another side tool to
investigate something in order to confirm it works. 

What that basically means is that garbage is going to pile up, and I'd prefer to keep on of that 
garbage on `kion-dgl` and keep the `dashgl` organization realtively clean. 
For any tool that's notable enoguh to use, I can reference it from the organization profile
page, or write a blog post about something in progress.
