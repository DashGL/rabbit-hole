One of the largest painpoints i had for Miku Legends 2 was working with the
CD image to be able to swap out the files. Originally I wanted to be able
to extract files from the disk, replace them and then rebuild the disk. I
wasn't able to figure out how to do this, and I ended up slicing up the
files into chunks of `0x800` bytes and then doing a search and replace
for each one of the individual chunks.

This was until I found [Hilltop](https://x.com/HilltopWorks)'s video on
[How to Romhack: Mega Man Legends 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0RmHFpdf-Y),
where he mentions the tool `mkpsxiso`. Unfortunately by the time I had
found the thing I was looking for, I was almost complete with the mod and
ended up pushing forward with the chunk approach. Now that Miku Legends 2
version 1.0 is out as a patch, I can go back and look into other approaches
that should make the process easier.

## Installing

First note that the project is over at: [https://github.com/Lameguy64/mkpsxiso](https://github.com/Lameguy64/mkpsxiso).
And first we'll install the dependencies.

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y cmake build-essential git
```

Then we will clone, compile and install.
```bash
cd /tmp
git clone https://github.com/Lameguy64/mkpsxiso.git
cd mkpsxiso
git submodule update --init --recursive
cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release .
cmake --build build
sudo cmake --install build
```

After that, the binaries will be copied to `/usr/local/bin/`.
You can confirm this with the `which` command.
```bash
which mkpsxiso
/usr/local/bin/mkpsxiso
```

And you can also run `mkpsxiso --help` to see the options.
