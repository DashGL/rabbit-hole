## Description of the problem

As I'm making DashGL and other tools over small amounts of time on the week end and at night, 
one of the aspect I end up spending a lot of time on is the aspect of figuring out how to bundle and deploy code.
I have a fair amount of experience writing with vanilla Javascript and Html, but I would prefer to get the benefits of working
with TypeScript, as well as not having to re-invent everything myself. And this means that I've started looking into frameworks 
more to see how I can benefit from using out of the box approaches.

## (Really) Serverless

None of what I do with DashGL generally involes a server. We have documentation pages, in the browser tools and static pages.
This means that I can take off the table things like Next, and really only focus on strictly static approaches like Astro and
Vite. I think within these two options it then comes down to how to use them.

## Documentation

For documentation I think this is basically solved. We can use [Astro Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build/) which 
should allow me to create documentation with MDX and everything should work out of the box. 

```sh
npm create astro@latest -- --template starlight
```

## Browser Tools

For browser tools I'm been bouncing back and forth between Vite and Astro in my head. And I think Vite is probably the better
approach for this. Originally I was thinking that potentially I could use Astro to bundle multiple different tools for one
project, but I don't think that I like that approach.

```sh
npm create vite@latest my-react-app -- --template react-ts
```

And the reason is that reverse engineering things is messy. A lot of times I'll have to spin up tools on the fly to make a one-off
thing as a test in order to unblock something else. And the general nature is that I don't have a clear idea of where I'll end up.
Maybe in retrospect if I wanted to go back and make a nice clean looking tool that worked for everything as a victory lap, I could potentially
make an Astrojs site with multiple tools that share the same code.

But reality just isn't that nice. I think potentially Vite + TypeScipt + Tailwind + React + shadcn. It's tempting to go with component 
libraries, but I find that component libraries are frustrating when you want to make small adjustments. And Shadcn/UI seems like a better approach
that while I might not update components 99% of the time, having the code in my project will make it that much easier to fix when it is there.

## Static Sites

For statis sites I'm really loving the approach of AstroJs + TypeScript + Tailwind + Daisy UI. Daisy is different in the sense that it's a
component library that you can't change, but the approach is pretty different for static stuff. On this side of things I'm looking for 
components that look good that I don't have to change using any kind of code. So the fast that DaisyUI looks good and minimizes the 
amount of code that I need to write while focusing on content is welcome.
