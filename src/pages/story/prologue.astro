    <h1>Pulled into the Digital World</h1>

    <p>
        This sequence of events covers what happens before Kion is pulled into
        the digital world. He works a normal shift with a few customers coming
        in right before closing, but kion manages to keep a smile while serving
        the last customer.

        Kion's friend and coworker asks him if we wants to play League of Waifus
        after work, something they do often. Kion declines saying that he wants
        to work on his game. This is mostly a lie as while kion has a bunch of
        ideas for games he would like to make, he has no idea how to actually
        approach the task. And while he has a sketchbook full of a few doodles,
        it's become a little bit of a joke for people to say they want to see
        it.

        After work Kion pulls back into his apartment. He's 19 years old and
        instead of going to university like most of his classmates he ended up
        staying home and getting a parttime job. He didn't have horrible grades,
        but they weren't great either and he didn't feel like he could commit to
        education when he wasn't sure of what he wanted to do. He ended up
        getting a parttime job and an apartment, and most of his paycheck goes
        to rent.

        Kion gets home, puts down his keys and throws his work clothes in the
        washing machine and takes a shower. He changes into shorts and a
        T-shirt, and stops by his computer to turn it on. And eats a cup of
        noodles before shifting over to the living room to watch some TV before
        realizing that time had gotten away from him.

        He goes to sit down in front of the computer. His mind is blank. It
        seems like his mind is full of ideas and creativity up until the point
        he sits down at his desk at which point he completely forgets what he
        wants to do. "What game again?", "Where do I start"? It's already late
        at night, and it's getting cold. Kion makes a cup of tea and puts on a
        hoodie and sits down at his desk again.

        "Focus", he tells himself as he tries to open a text editor to figure
        out what to do before getting drowsy and falls asleep on his keyboard. A
        few hours later he wakes up realizing there is drool all over his
        keyboard. His monitor is flickering and making a static noise. "Oh my
        god", Kion cries out as he doesn't have a great computer, but he doesn't
        have a lot of money to replace it either.

        As he scrambles to grab his drink and some tissues and start wiping up
        the keyboard, the monitor starts to move and shake as the keyboard
        rattles on the desk. Kion's body starts to pixelize and be sucked into
        the monitor as his hand stops being physical, the cup he was holding
        falls and shatters on the ground as he falls head first into the
        Digi-World.
