            <h1>Pulled into the Digital World</h1>
            <p>
                This sequence of events covers what happens before Kion is
                pulled into the digital world. He works a normal shift with a
                few customers coming in right before closing, but kion manages
                to keep a smile while serving the last customer.
            </p>
            <p>
                Kion's friend and coworker asks him if we wants to play League
                of Waifus after work, something they do often. Kion declines
                saying that he wants to work on his game. This is mostly a lie
                as while kion has a bunch of ideas for games he would like to
                make, he has no idea how to actually approach the task. And
                while he has a sketchbook full of a few doodles, it's become a
                little bit of a joke for people to say they want to see it.
            </p>
            <p>
                After work Kion pulls back into his apartment. He's 19 years old
                and instead of going to university like most of his classmates
                he ended up staying home and getting a parttime job. He didn't
                have horrible grades, but they weren't great either and he
                didn't feel like he could commit to education when he wasn't
                sure of what he wanted to do. He ended up getting a parttime job
                and an apartment, and most of his paycheck goes to rent.
            </p>
            <p>
                Kion gets home, puts down his keys and throws his work clothes
                in the washing machine and takes a shower. He changes into
                shorts and a T-shirt, and stops by his computer to turn it on.
                And eats a cup of noodles before shifting over to the living
                room to watch some TV before realizing that time had gotten away
                from him.
            </p>
            <p>
                He goes to sit down in front of the computer. His mind is blank.
                It seems like his mind is full of ideas and creativity up until
                the point he sits down at his desk at which point he completely
                forgets what he wants to do. "What game again?", "Where do I
                start"? It's already late at night, and it's getting cold. Kion
                makes a cup of tea and puts on a hoodie and sits down at his
                desk again.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Focus", he tells himself as he tries to open a text editor to
                figure out what to do before getting drowsy and falls asleep on
                his keyboard. A few hours later he wakes up realizing there is
                drool all over his keyboard. His monitor is flickering and
                making a static noise. "Oh my god", Kion cries out as he doesn't
                have a great computer, but he doesn't have a lot of money to
                replace it either.
            </p>
            <p>
                As he scrambles to grab his drink and some tissues and start
                wiping up the keyboard, the monitor starts to move and shake as
                the keyboard rattles on the desk. Kion's body starts to pixelize
                and be sucked into the monitor as his hand stops being physical,
                the cup he was holding falls and shatters on the ground as he
                falls head first into the Digi-World.
