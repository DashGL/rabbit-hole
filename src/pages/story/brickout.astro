    <h2>Program</h2>
    <h3>Step 1: Setting Up the Development Environment</h3>
    <img src={images[0]}/>
    <p>
        Installing the necessary tools and libraries for Raspberry Pi
        development. Creating a new project directory for your Brickout game.
    </p>
    <h3>Step 2: Configuring SDL and OpenGL</h3>
    <img src={images[1]}/>
    <p>
        Initializing SDL and setting up an OpenGL context for rendering.
        Creating a window for the game.
    </p>
    <h3>Step 3: Creating the Title Screen</h3>
    <img src={images[2]}/>
    <p>
        Designing the title screen with text and graphics. Handling user input
        to start the game.
    </p>
    <h3>Step 4: Implementing the Game Loop</h3>
    <img src={images[3]}/>
    <p>
        Setting up the main game loop for controlling gameplay. Handling events,
        updating game logic, and rendering the game.
    </p>
    <h3>Step 5: Building the Paddle</h3>
    <img src={images[4]}/>
    <p>
        Creating a paddle object that the player can control. Implementing
        movement and collision detection.
    </p>
    <h3>Step 6: Spawning the Ball</h3>
    <img src={images[5]}/>
    <p>
        Generating the ball that bounces around the screen. Applying initial
        velocity and collision detection.
    </p>
    <h3>Step 7: Designing the Bricks</h3>
    <img src={images[6]}/>
    <p>
        Creating a grid of bricks for the player to break. Managing different
        types of bricks and their states.
    </p>
    <h3>Step 8: Handling Collisions</h3>
    <img src={images[7]}/>
    <p>
        Implementing collision detection between the ball, paddle, and bricks.
        Updating game state based on collisions.
    </p>
    <h3>Step 9: Adding Scoring and Lives</h3>
    <img src={images[8]}/>
    <p>
        Keeping track of the player's score and remaining lives. Displaying this
        information on the screen.
    </p>
    <h3>Step 10: Implementing Game Over</h3>
    <img src={images[9]}/>
    <p>
        Detecting when the player has no lives left. Displaying a game over
        screen and allowing the player to restart.
    </p>
    <h3>Step 11: Adding Power-Ups</h3>
    <img src={images[10]}/>
    <p>
        Implementing power-up items that enhance gameplay. Modifying paddle,
        ball, or brick behavior with power-ups.
    </p>
    <h3>Step 12: Creating a Success Screen</h3>
    <img src={images[11]}/>
    <p>
        Designing a success screen for when the player completes all levels.
        Allowing the player to restart or return to the title screen.
    </p>
    <h3>Step 13: Sound and Music</h3>
    <img src={images[12]}/>
    <p>
        Integrating sound effects and background music to enhance the gaming
        experience. Implementing audio control for different game events.
    </p>
    <h3>Step 14: Final Testing and Deployment</h3>
    <img src={images[13]}/>
    <p>
        Thoroughly testing the game on the Raspberry Pi. Preparing the game for
        distribution and deployment.
    </p>
